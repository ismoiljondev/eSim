    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions about the eSIM",
    "q1": "When does my data plan start?",
    "a1": "Your plan starts the moment you activate your eSIM by scanning the QR code on your smartphone.",
    "q2": "Can I make phone calls and send messages with the eSIM?",
    "a2": "Unfortunately, the Japan plan only allows you to use mobile data. It does not include a phone number for mobile calls or messages. You can still make calls using apps like WhatsApp or Telegram.",
    "q3": "When will I receive my eSIM?",
    "a3": "Once you purchase an eSIM, you will receive it immediately to your email address. You then just need to scan the QR code to activate the SIM. Note that no refunds can be made once you purchase your eSIM. See our refund policy for more information.",
    "q4": "What is the network speed of the eSIM?",
    "a4": "The eSIM offers maximum speed coverage. But bear in mind that in some areas of limited coverage there may be a lower speed connection.",
    "q5": "Do I have to activate data roaming on my device?",
    "a5": "Yes. To ensure that your eSIM gets the best coverage, you must turn on data roaming on your mobile settings. This will not incur any additional charges, as long as you have already set up the eSIM.",
    "q6": "What do I do if I delete or lose my eSIM's QR code?",
    "a6": "If you cannot find the code, please contact our 24/7 customer support team at support@getroamify.com or our online chat function. We will resend the code to your email.",
    "q7": "What happens if I use up my data or my days of validity?",
    "a7": "If you use all your data or run out of days, your eSIM card will no longer work and you will lose internet connection.",
    "q8": "Can I renew or extend the data on my eSIM?",
    "a8": "Yes, you can do so by logging into your customer panel on the MilliySim website. You will find the data plans you can purchase there. Once you've made your purchase, it will be activated immediately on the eSIM you have linked.",
    "q9": "Can I share data with other devices?",
    "a9": "Yes, you can share data with other devices. You can do this by activating the hotspot on your device.",
    "q10": "How do I set up the eSIM on my device?",
    "a10": "Once you make your purchase, we will send you an email with precise instructions to install your eSIM in two ways: by scanning the QR code or by copying and pasting the manual installation codes. To install with the first option, it is essential that the QR code is printed or on another device. Otherwise, you can follow the manual installation instructions for your MilliySim eSIM. If your device is iOS, go to Settings → Cellular → Add eSIM and scan the QR code or paste the manual installation codes sent to your email. Then follow the on-screen instructions to select your new eSIM for mobile data and calls. If your device is Android, follow the instructions we will email you to install your MilliySim eSIM. Remember that your MilliySim data plan should only be activated when you arrive at your destination. Once there, select your MilliySim eSIM as your preferred option to make calls, then activate data roaming and the MilliySim calling plan. All our eSIM products come with complete instructions for easy setup. If you have any questions or need help, don't hesitate to contact our support team. We are available 24/7.",
    "q11": "When should I set up my eSIM?",
    "a11": "Set up your eSIM before your departure. Once you reach your destination, just activate the data plan and turn on data roaming. We recommend you print the QR code and take it with you on your trip just in case. Remember that you need internet access to activate the eSIM. Setup is quick, and you’ll be able to enjoy your data plan right away.",
    "q12": "How can I check how much data and minutes do I have left?",
    "a12": "To check your remaining data balance, simply log in to our web app using the access details sent via email when you made your purchase. You can also check your data balance in your device's data settings. To check your remaining minutes balance for making or receiving calls, please contact our support team.",
    "q13": "Can I use my physical SIM card and MilliySim eSIM at the same time?",
    "a13": "Yes! You can keep your physical SIM card with your MilliySim eSIM simultaneously on your device. Just make sure you choose your eSIM as your default voice line and preferred option for mobile data in your device settings. Please note that if you leave your physical SIM card activated, you might get extra roaming fees from your network provider."
