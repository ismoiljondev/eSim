Simply enter the details provided.\n\nStep 4: Did you already scan the QR code? If so, you may have already installed the eSIM successfully. To check, go into settings, and navigate to your Cellular/SIM card settings.\n\nStep 5: If none of these steps worked, feel free to reach out to our 24/7 support team! You can reach out via email or live chat.",
